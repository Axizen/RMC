- **Technical Writer**: 25% of time

## Risk Management

The following risks have been identified for the implementation:

### 1. Integration Issues

**Risk:** Components may not work together as expected after updates.

**Mitigation:**
- Thorough integration testing
- Incremental updates and testing
- Clear documentation of component interactions

### 2. Performance Impact

**Risk:** The decoupled architecture may introduce performance overhead.

**Mitigation:**
- Performance profiling and optimization
- Benchmarking before and after changes
- Optimization of critical paths

### 3. Learning Curve

**Risk:** Developers may struggle to adapt to the new architecture.

**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive documentation and training
- Code examples and templates
- Regular Q&A sessions

### 4. Schedule Slippage

**Risk:** The implementation may take longer than expected.

**Mitigation:**
- Realistic time estimates with buffers
- Regular progress tracking and adjustments
- Prioritization of critical components

## Conclusion

This document outlines the immediate next steps for implementing the decoupled architecture in the Platcom Framework. By following this plan, we can complete Phase 2 (Core Components) and begin Phase 3 (Character Integration) in the next few weeks.

The implementation will be done incrementally, with thorough testing and validation at each step. Documentation and training will be ongoing to ensure that all developers understand and can use the new architecture effectively.

Regular updates to this plan will be provided as the implementation progresses.
