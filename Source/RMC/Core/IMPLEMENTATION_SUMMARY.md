| Performance overhead | Low | Performance profiling and optimization in Phase 5 |
| Blueprint compatibility | Medium | Blueprint-friendly wrappers in Phase 4 |
| Regression bugs | Medium | Comprehensive unit and integration testing |

## Conclusion

The implementation of the decoupled architecture in the Platcom Framework is progressing well. Phase 1 (Foundation) has been completed, and Phase 2 (Core Components) is in progress. The core documentation has been completed, providing a solid foundation for developers to understand and use the architecture.

The next steps are to complete Phase 2, begin Phase 3 (Character Integration), and continue with Phase 7 (Documentation and Training). The implementation is on track to deliver the expected benefits in terms of reduced coupling, improved testability, enhanced extensibility, and better error handling.

Regular updates to this summary will be provided as the implementation progresses.
